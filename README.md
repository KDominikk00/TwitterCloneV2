# TwitterCloneV2

Welcome to the TwitterCloneV2 project! This is a web application that replicates core functionalities of Twitter, allowing users to post tweets, follow others, and interact with content.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following languages and frameworks:

- **Angular**: A powerful front-end framework for building dynamic web applications, allowing for efficient component-based architecture.
- **Firebase**: Used for backend services, including authentication, database storage (Firestore), and real-time updates.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling and enables responsive design through predefined classes.

## Features

- User authentication: Sign up, log in, and manage user sessions securely with Firebase.
- Post tweets: Create, read, update, and delete tweets.
- Follow users: Connect with other users to view their tweets in your feed.
- Real-time updates: Experience instant updates without refreshing the page, thanks to Firebase's real-time capabilities.
- Responsive design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.
